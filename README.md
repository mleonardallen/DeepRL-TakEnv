# TAK - A Beautiful Game

Tak is a new abstract strategy game created by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss, based on the game in the book “The Wise Man's Fear” by Patrick Rothfuss.  Through KickStarter, the game became funded and finally distributed to backers in December 2016.

The problem at hand is to program an agent that is able to play the boardgame Tak competitively as measured through game score and win ratio.  

Rather than approaching as a supervised learning problem, relying on human expertise to craft features, a possible solution is to leverage reinforcement learning, allowing the agent to learn the game over time.
